# ts-node18-template
A starter template for typescript projects using node 18.

## Description
Why I decided to create this template is because I used to setup nodejs project many times and this template 
is a good representation of a minimal nodejs project. Hope you find it useful for your projects as well.

## Pre-requisites
- node 18
- pnpm

## Getting start
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:gio-shara-code/ts-node18-template.git`
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the dev server using `concurrently`


`@tsconfig/node18` is used to provide the typescript configuration for node 18.
 
This template can be used for any type of Nodejs project. Have fun with it.
